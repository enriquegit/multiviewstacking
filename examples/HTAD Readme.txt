HTAD

A Home-Tasks Activities Dataset with Wrist-accelerometer and Audio Features.

The dataset contains wrist-accelerometer and audio data from people performing at-home tasks such as sweeping, brushing teeth, washing hands, or watching TV. These activities represent a subset of activities that are needed to be able to live independently. Being able to detect activities with wearable devices in real-time has the potential for the realization of assistive technologies with applications in different domains such as elderly care and mental health monitoring. Preliminary results show that using machine learning with the dataset leads to promising results, but also that there is still improvement potential. By making this dataset public, researchers can test different machine learning algorithms for activity recognition, especially, sensor data fusion methods.
