The digits (Multple Features) dataset was published by Robert Duin and can be accessed here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/72/multiple+features

The original dataset includes all views as separate files. The version of the dataset included here has a single .csv file which was generated by concatenating the columns of all the individual view files and adding an extra column "class" that represents the digit.
