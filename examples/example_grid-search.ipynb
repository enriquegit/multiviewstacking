    "# Grid search with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the `multiviestacking` library with scikit-learn grid search functionality to find the best hyperparameters. We will use the `GridSearchCV` class that tries every possible combination defined in the grid of hyperparameters and returns the best combination based on the specified score (in this example it is *accuracy*). Here the hyperparameters are the meta-learner and the first-level-learnvers. The hyperparameters are specified as a dictionary where the key is the name of the hyperparameter and the value is the list of possible values. In this example we will try a KNN and a Random Forest as the meta-learner. The first-level-learners will be either two SVMs or two KNN classifiers. The `cv` parameter of `GridSearchCV` specifies the number of folds for the cross-validation procedure used to find the best hyperparameters. The `scoring` parameter specifies the metric to be optimized. Since this procedure can be computationally expensive, the number of estimators for random forest was set to 20 as opposed to 50 like in the previous examples."

But to make things easier, in this case a prefix was added so we can get the corresponding views' column indices.\n"
